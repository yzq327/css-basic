        <h1>Wi-Fi is a lifeline in the pandemic. It's harder to get if you're homeless</h1>
        <h2>Simply charging a phone is an even bigger hurdle. There's help, but the need is greater.</h2>
        <p>It's always hard for Franz Lupo to keep his phone charged, and he's using some of that juice to talk with me. From a San Francisco Bay Area town where he lives in a tent, Lupo tells me over the phone that he typically goes to Starbucks or the local library to restore his battery to full bars. </p>
        <p>With these places closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, Lupo has come to rely on a carwash with a power outlet he can access after hours.  </p>
        <p>"It's hard to find a place around here that will let you come in and charge the phone," he said, a hint of Texas drawl in his voice.</p>
